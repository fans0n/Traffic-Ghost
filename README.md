# Traffic-Ghost
  With the development of Internet of Things technology, the types and quantities of Internet of Things devices continue to increase exponentially. During the security testing of IoT devices, we often dynamically modify the communication data for fuzzing to discover more unknown security vulnerabilities. We've developed a tool that can test IoT devices such as cameras, speakers, and routers.
  This is an IOT device traffic attack research tool, easy to extend and portable framework, designed to monitor and tamper IOT device traffic, with reconnaissance and attack features to provide one-stop services for security researchers. It is easy to use, anyone can use it to achieve their own hijacking attack.
  The tool uses a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) to disguise itself as a terminal that participates in a session, and is not seen by other terminals, hijacking, monitoring, and modifying the traffic transmitted between the IOT device and the server. The tool has also been designed as an automated attack tool for traffic, and its attack methods are even more difficult to watch, making it difficult for users to directly detect it. Itâ€™s A Swiss Army Knife that can be used for Ethernet reconnaissance and data traffic attacks between IOT devices.
